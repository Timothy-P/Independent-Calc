This is a new calculator like the last few, and I find it to be one of the better ones since it's primarily made by me (the only part that isn't is the jQuery stuff).

I've worked hard on this, and it might be one of my more interesting projects since I have to do .replaceAll() for some of the functions, using variables to count if you have put in all the parenthesis (so you don't mess it up), and more.

Please look at what it can do now, and you'll see what it can do in the future. Some functions aren't that useful, but they're there for *if* you'll need them.
